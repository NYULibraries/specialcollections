These interviews describe seven decades of Left politics from the 1910s through the 1970s.

            <p>New York University’s Tamiment Library established the Oral History of the American Left (OHAL) in 1976. The purpose of this project was to expand the archive of American labor and radicalism through the creation of “living documents” by recording the memories of veteran activists. The idea, according to Project Director Paul Buhle, was “to create an archive of recorded reminiscences by participants in trade union struggles, political organizations, and grass-roots political and cultural activity.” The archive is intended to preserve the identity and legacy of the Left in the United States and to not overlook any of the diverse cultures involved in the movement or undervalue past periods of conflict and oppression.</p>
            <p>Complementing the above goals, Buhle was motivated to use the growing practice of oral history to shed light on and “capture a collective understanding of the little understood 1919-1929 decade.” Additionally, he sought to add substance to the emergent “new social history” by uncovering previously ignored perspectives through the stories of his subjects. Buhle believed these untold stories, such as about the roles of women and midlevel activists, would add depth and complexity to traditional research methods and challenge our understanding of social movements.</p>
            <p>Paul Buhle has been the director of the project since its founding in 1976. The staff included Roger Keeran who was co-director in the early years and Jon Bloom who joined the project in 1977 to work as an interviewer, coordinator, and fundraiser. Additional interviewers included Ruth F. Prago, Bea Lemisch, Amelia Green and several NYU students.</p>
            <p>Interviewing began with a series of small grants provided by the Rabinowitz and Bronson Cutting Foundations. The New Jersey Historical Commission provided funding in 1978 to support interviews on radicalism in New Jersey between 1930 and 1960. Later, Ruth F. Prago developed the idea to start a radio series based on interviews held for the OHAL collection. Together with Pacifica Radio the project received a one-year grant from the New York State Council for the Humanities to conduct interviews with twenty-five women about radicalism during the 1930s. Radio producers used these interviews to create the radio series “Grandma was an Activist,” first broadcast in 1983. OHAL received major funding in 1982–1983 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This support enabled Paul Buhle to build a comprehensive collection of oral histories regarding ethnic-immigrant radicalism, its press and fraternal organizations. The NEH grant also enabled OHAL to collect hundreds of hours of interviews made by filmmakers on American anarchism, the Hollywood blacklist, the Communist Party, the Columbia University student strike of 1968, and other subjects.</p>
            <p>The project also produced seven issues of a newsletter, and the transcript of a two-day conference co-sponsored by OHAL and the Tamiment Library on the occasion of the opening of the Max Shactman Papers in 1983.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>Series I: OHAL Main Collection</p>
            <p>The tapes and transcripts in the Oral History of the American Left Series I collection came from a variety of sources. Most of the interviews were done by Jon Bloom, Paul Buhle, Bea Lemisch, and Ruth F. Prago. They cover many subjects including: immigrant/ethnic radicalism, labor, women's history, radical newspapers, fraternal organizations, and student radicalism between 1910 and 1980. The earliest interviews were done with men and women who could recall the 1910s–1920s. Later interviews focused on the effects of the Russian Revolution on the Left in the United States, the formation of social and cultural institutions by the "New Immigrant" groups, the history of Socialism and Anarchism, and the troubled early years of American Communism. In addition, notable efforts were made to interview rank and file or middle-level leadership activists, to focus on "radical women" and to focus on the labor movement, specifically the needle trades unions and the early years of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. For the most part, these interviewees did not leave behind written records so their oral histories are the only available historical record.</p>
            <p>The immigrant ethnic interviews might be the most unique element of the collection. OHAL interviewed representative figures from the Jewish, Finnish, Slovenian, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Italian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Japanese, Scandinavian, and Spanish Left. A handful of tapes recall the African American experience. The collection includes several interviews with participants of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the US component of the International Brigades which fought in the Spanish Civil War, and covers activities related to the group. There are other interviews documenting the long tenure of Jasper McLevy, Socialist Party Mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut from 1933-1957.</p>
            <p>Ninety-five percent of these interviews are on cassette tapes with accompanying indexes. The rest are transcripts without tapes. The collection is currently being digitized and approximately half of the interviews are available on CD. In the near future, the entire collection will be available on CD. In addition, we are having numerous interviews be transcribed. We are aiming for half of the collection to have electronic and paper transcripts by mid 2011. Information about format is noted in the inventory.</p>
            <p>Notable individuals interviewed include: Herbert Aptheker, Rosalyn Fraad Baxandall, Daniel Berrigan, Abner Berry, James Boggs, George Breitman, Rose Chernin, Malcolm Cowley, Samuel Darcy, Solon De Leon, Hal Draper, Raya Dunayevskaya, Melech Epstein, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Hugo Gellert, Todd Gitlin, Martine Glaberman, Albert Glotzer, Itshe Goldberg, Louis Harap, Michael Harrington, Howard "Stretch" Johnson, Mary Kolehmainen, Meridel Le Sueur, A.B.

            <p>Series II: Fred Zimring/Barrows Dunham Collection This series contains interviews conducted by Dr. Zimring for his doctoral dissertation “McCarthyism, the Cold War and Temple University: the Dismissal of Professor Barrows Dunham from Temple.” He interviewed numerous individuals about the 1953 case including Professor Dunham, his friends and colleagues, and Temple University faculty and administrators.</p>
            <p>Series III: David Leviatin/Reynolds Hill Collection Interviews in this series are with members of the Reynolds Hill Colony, originally called “Followers of the Trail,” in upstate New York. The group was founded by eastern European immigrant Jewish garment workers and included their own hiking camp for physical exercises and political discussions. Permission to use these interviews must be granted by the interviewer. Please contact the Tamiment Library for more information.</p>
            <p>Series IV: Filmmakers’ tapes This series contains interviews conducted for documentary films on the history of American radicalism. They cover a range of subjects such as American anarchism, American Communism, the Hollywood Blacklist and the 1968 Columbia University student strike. Examples of films included in the collection are The Salt of the Earth. Interviews are listed under the title of each film for which they were produced and they are a mix of tapes and transcriptions. This series contains some restricted material where permission of the filmmaker is required.</p>
            <p>Series V: Tamiment Institute Tapes This series contains recordings of meetings, speeches, and interviews held during the 1950s and the 1960s.</p>
