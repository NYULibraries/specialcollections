            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">Sylvester Manor is the home of the original European settlers on Shelter Island in eastern Long Island, New York, created in 1652 with the arrival of Nathaniel and Grissell Sylvester. For over 350 years and continuing to this day, the Manor has remained with descendents of the original Sylvesters, and the Sylvester Manor Archive contains documents dating from its European settlement to the late-20th century. The earliest documents provide evidence of an operational northern provisioning plantation involved in the Atlantic trade of the 17th century, while later portions of the collection document the lives of several notable descendents including Ezra L’Hommedieu, an attorney and politician from the American Revolutionary Era, Samuel Smith Gardiner, an attorney from a prominent family of eastern Long Island, and Eben Norton Horsford, a scientist at the forefront of the development of American food science and chemistry and a successful entrepreneur.</abstract>

            <p>Materials are divided into record groups by their general family affiliation (Sylvester, L’Hommedieu, Gardiner, Horsford, and Fiske) and subdivided into series consisting of individuals’ papers. Women that crossed family divisions, such as Mary Catherine L’Hommedieu (Gardiner), and Phoebe Gardiner (Horsford), were included in their married family because most records date from after marriage. Subseries are identified by the document or material types. Materials are arranged depending on the record type; correspondence is arranged alphabetically by correspondent and then chronologically, most other materials are arranged chronologically except where noted.</p>

            <p>The Sylvester Manor Archive contains correspondence, financial records, manuscripts, photographs, artworks, and realia from the owners and related family members of the Sylvester Manor. The Archive spans more than 350 years and different portions will likely be of interest for different purposes. The earliest documents in the collection are particularly strong in early land deeds and records relating to Long Island, including deeds containing Native American signatures, notably that of Wyandanch, sachem of the Mantaukett Indians. A number of wills and ledgers relating to trade in the Atlantic world in the late 17th and early 18th century are also present. Later records are the largely the personal records of the individuals who lived at Sylvester Manor, several of whom had noteworthy careers in their respective fields. The records of three individuals comprise the bulk of the collection: Ezra L’Hommedieu, a prominent attorney and politician; Samuel Smith Gardiner, a Long Island and New York attorney; and Eben Norton Horsford, an early leader in the science of food chemistry and owner of the Rumford Chemical Works. Other significant groups of records include the early records of the Sylvester, Brinley, and Lloyd families, as well as the papers of Cornelia Horsford. A large number of photographs dating from approximately the 1870s through the 1930s document Sylvester Manor and its grounds as well as members of the Horsford and Fiske families.</p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Sylvester Manor and its grounds are located on Shelter Island, an 8,000-acre island situated between the north and south forks of eastern Long Island that was inhabited by Manhansett Indians until its purchase in 1651 by the first permanent European settlers. Nathaniel Sylvester, an Englishman born and raised in Amsterdam, and three Barbadian planters, his brother, Constant, Thomas Middleton, and Thomas Rouse, bought the property to use in the Caribbean provisioning trade. Enslaved Africans, impressed Natives, and European indentured servants raised livestock and produced timber for barrels, and food to sell in the West Indies, where most arable land was devoted to valuable sugar cane. In 1653, Nathaniel (Nathaniell in most records) Sylvester and his wife Grissell Brinley (also recorded Grizzell), married and moved to Shelter Island, creating the establishment that would later bear their family name. The property was granted royal manor status by Governor Richard Nicoll of New York Colony in 1666.</p>
            <p>In 1752 with the death of Brinley Sylvester, the estate passed to his daughter, Mary (Nathaniel’s great-great granddaughter), and her husband Thomas Dering. The Manor remained in the Dering family for another two generations before debt forced the sale of the property. Dering records do not appear in any number in the Archive. The property was purchased from the Derings in 1827 by Samuel Smith Gardiner, a Suffolk County and New York attorney who had married into a different branch of Sylvester descendents.</p>
            <p>Samuel Gardiner’s wife was Mary Catherine L’Hommedieu, the daughter of Ezra L’Hommedieu, a very prominent attorney, national and state political representative, Suffolk County Clerk for some twenty years, and a great-great grandson of Nathaniel Sylvester. Although Ezra L’Hommedieu never owned Sylvester Manor, the collection houses a substantial volume of his papers. The Gardiners produced three daughters, Mary L’Hommedieu Gardiner, Phoebe Dayton Gardiner (sometimes spelled Phebe, particularly in earlier records), and Frances (Fanny) Gardiner.</p>
            <p>Mary L'Hommedieu Gardiner wed Eben Norton Horsford, a professor of chemistry at Harvard University, a pioneer in food science, and founder of the Rumford Chemical Works in Providence, Rhode Island. Mary and E.N. produced four daughters, Lillian (also Lilian), Mary Katherine (Kate), Gertrude, and Mary Gardiner (Mamie). Mary died in 1855, and E.N. Horsford married her sister Phoebe two years later. Phoebe gave birth to one daughter, Cornelia Conway Fenton (referred to as Nellie in her younger years). Samuel Gardiner died in 1859, passing the Manor to Phoebe and E.N. Horsford, at which time it became a summer home, as the Horsfords were well established in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Following her mother's death in 1903, Cornelia Horsford, who never married, retained the property until her death in 1944. The property then passed to the Fiske family, a family of Boston attorneys into which Gertrude Horsford had married. Augustus Henry Fiske briefly inherited the Manor before passing the estate to his son Andrew, who held the Manor from 1949 until his death in 1992. His widow, Alice Hench Fiske, retained life interest until her death in 2006.</p>
            <p>The original house was probably constructed soon after Nathaniel and Grissell’s arrival. Provisioning activities likely ended in 1680 at Nathaniel’s death, but farming and trading continued. After Brinley Sylvester, a successful merchant operating regionally in the New England and New York sphere, tore down the first dwelling, he constructed the current surviving house around 1735 By the time Samuel Gardiner became the owner of the manor in the early 19th century, the Manor property had been significantly reduced and much of the remaining arable land was leased to local farmers. When the Horsfords took possession of the manor they hosted members of Boston's intellectual and social elite during the summers. Some small-scale farming continued. The existing gardens were formalized and expanded, and the Horsfords set up monuments and fenced enclosures, including two extant graveyards, to relate their understanding of the landscape features of the property's history. After her mother's death, Cornelia Horsford maintained the home as a summer residence, continuing work on the gardens and overseeing a substantial renovation to the residence by the well-known architect, Henry Bacon, in 1908.</p>
            <p>The estate currently comprises approximately 243 acres, the manor house, and several subsidiary houses, barns and out-buildings, most of which date to the nineteenth century. Sylvester Manor remains in the possession of family descendents and is today being cultivated as an educational organic farm. In addition, nine seasons of field schools were conducted by archaeological teams from the University of Massachusetts Boston, providing further information on the original buildings and activities conducted on the site. See http://www.fiskecenter.umb.edu/excavations.htm for information on the archaeological activities.</p>

                    <p>This record group contains records of the Sylvester, Brinley and Lloyd families, dating from 1649 to 1786. These documents provide evidence of an early northern provisioning plantation actively involved in the Atlantic trades and employing African slave labor, Native Americans, and early European settlers. Financial and accounting evidence of trading activities as well as a number of wills and land ownership documents of various family members provide detailed inventories of possessions during this period.</p>

                        <p>The Sylvester Family was involved in the original purchase of Shelter Island in 1651 for the purposes of establishing a provisioning plantation for its Barbados sugar operations. Nathaniel Sylvester (1610-1680) was a member of an English merchant family that had briefly relocated to the Netherlands before moving to Barbados to manage the family’s interests in a sugar plantation. He married Grissell Brinley (1635-1687), who was the daughter of Francis Brinley, a merchant of some wealth based in Boston and Rhode Island. The couple came to live on Shelter Island in 1652 as the first Europeans to permanently settle there. The couple produced 11 children, including Giles Sylvester (1657-1704), who inherited the heart of the estate from his father, while portions were given to the four other sons (portions of the island had also been given to Constant Sylvester). The Sylvesters were sympathetic to the Quaker religion, and provided shelter to several of its followers during persecutions in other areas of New England. After Nathaniel’s death, the property was no longer affiliated with the sugar plantation in Barbados that had been operated by Nathaniel’s brother Constant. Giles Sylvester died without heir and following a legal dispute the property passed to Brinley Sylvester (1694-1752), Giles’ nephew via his brother Nathaniel II. Brinley Sylvester pursued trading and other maritime merchant activities. He married Mary Burrough and had two daughters, of which Mary Sylvester would marry Thomas Dering and later inherit the estate.</p>

                        <p>The papers in the series contain records relating to the members of the Sylvester family and include land deeds, wills, correspondence, manorial grants for Shelter Island, and accounts and ledgers of their merchant activities. A number of land and legal documents relate to Horse Neck Island (now known as Lloyd’s Neck) on the northern shore of Long Island; this property was purchased by Nathaniel for his daughter Grissell, who was engaged to be married to Latimer Sampson, who died before they were wed. Grissell then married James Lloyd, whose papers are included in the Lloyd Family series below.</p>

                        <p>Grissell Sylvester (b. 1652), Nathaniel and Grissell’s daughter, was married to James Lloyd (d. 1698), a Boston merchant, after her first fiancé, Latimer Sampson, died before they were wed. Following a dispute over the ownership of the Horse Neck (now called Lloyd's Neck) property that was purchased by Nathaniel Sylvester and given to Latimer Sampson, it was determined that Latimer Sampson’s will gave the property to Grissell. Grissell and James resided in Boston, but their son Henry Lloyd (1685-1763) moved to Long Island from Rhode Island in 1711 and occupied the property.</p>

                        <p>Although never owner of Sylvester Manor, Ezra L’Hommedieu (1734-1811) was a person of considerable prominence in the history of Long Island and New York State. He was educated at Yale College and graduated in 1754, after which he began his legal practice in Southold, where he lived his entire life when not away for political office, and when the family was forced to relocate to Middletown, Connecticut during the occupation of Long Island by British forces in the Revolution, and again during the blockade in the War of 1812. He was married twice, first to Charity Floyd in 1765, and after Charity Floyd’s death in 1785 to Mary Catherine Havens in 1803. Ezra and Mary Catherine had one daughter, Mary Catherine L’Hommedieu. Ezra L’Hommedieu was a Patriot, and began public service in 1775 with his election to the Provincial Congress. His list of national, state and local political positions is extensive: delegate to the Provincial Congress 1775-1777; member of the New York State Assembly 1777-1783; member of the Continental Congress from 1779-1783 and 1788; member of the New York State Senate from 1784-1792 and again from 1794-1809; member of the state constitutional convention in 1801; Suffolk County Clerk from 1784 to March 1810 and from March 1811 until his death; and Regent of the University of the State of New York 1787-1811. L’Hommedieu was also granted land patents to extensive holdings in the area of the Twenty Townships, a large tract of land purchased from the Oneida Indians in 1788 in what is now Central New York. His papers provide extensive documentation dealing with the surveying, sale and leasing of these lands. He also held lands near Plattsburg, New York and Sandwich, Massachusetts, the latter stemming from the Bourn family’s property.</p>

                        <p>Samuel Smith Gardiner (1789-1859) was a member of the prominent and wealthy Gardiner family, who traced their ancestry to Lion Gardiner, who had settled Gardiner’s Island in 1639 as the first English settlement in New York. Samuel S. Gardiner was educated at Williams College in Massachusetts, and practiced law in Suffolk County and New York. He was one of the secretaries of the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821, and member of the New York State Legislature from 1823-1824. He married Mary Catherine L’Hommedieu in 1823. The couple had three daughters, Mary L’Hommedieu Gardiner, Phebe Dayton Gardiner, and Frances Gardiner. In 1827, the Dering family was forced to place the Sylvester Manor estate at auction because of debt, and Samuel S. Gardiner purchased the manor house and 578 acres for $10,400.</p>

She married Samuel Smith Gardiner in 1823 and gave birth to three daughters: Mary L’Hommedieu Gardiner in 1824, Phebe Dayton Gardiner in 1826, and Frances (Fanny) Eliza Gardiner in 1832. Mary and Phebe would both marry E.N. Horsford (see below), while Frances married George Martin Lane, a Harvard professor of Latin Language and Literature, in 1857.</p>

                    <p>This record group forms the largest portion of the collection, containing the materials of E.N. Horsford and his wives and children, with E.N. Horsford’s papers creating the bulk of those materials. E.N. Horsford’s materials consist of a large volume of correspondence, both personal and professional, scientific notes, journals and manuscripts relating to early developments in food science and chemistry, business and patent materials relating to the Rumford Chemical Works and the St. Helena Gold Mine, materials relating to the properties and communities in Shelter Island and Cambridge, artwork, engravings and other visual materials, and miscellaneous other manuscripts and records. A number of papers relating to Wellesley College, with which E.N. Horsford was closely associated, are also included. The papers of Mary L’Hommedieu Gardiner Horsford and Phoebe Gardiner Horsford are also included, containing primarily correspondence along with some manuscripts and financial and legal papers relating to Sylvester Manor. Cornelia Horsford’s papers contain extensive records of the renovation of Sylvester Manor performed in 1908, as well as a substantial volume of her own papers and artworks. Kate and Lillian are also represented by a small but significant volume of documents, primarily correspondence, while Gertrude and Mary Gardiner Horsford only have a few files of correspondence in the collection. The Horsfords also conducted extensive genealogical research and a number of copies of earlier family records are present here, dating as far back as the original Sylvester family.</p>

                        <p>Eben Norton Horsford (1818-1893), was the only son of Jerediah and Maria C. Horsford of Moscow, New York. Jerediah Horsford was a missionary to the Seneca Indians of New York and became an established expert in the language of the tribe. He would serve in the New York Assembly in 1831 and in the U.S. Congress from 1851-1853. In addition to Eben, the couple had four daughters: Maria Horsford (married name Byum), Julia Horsford (Norton), Eliza Horsford (Tryon), and Laura Horsford. E.N. Horsford attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), graduating in 1838 with a civil engineering degree. He then was employed on the Geographical Survey of New York, working under James Hall, a noted geologist and paleontologist also from RPI. From 1840-1844 E.N. Horsford was a professor of Mathematics and Science at the Albany Female Academy, a higher education institution for women. Here he would meet Mary and Phoebe Gardiner as students. During this same period, E.N. lectured at Newark College in Delaware, which later became the University of Delaware. In 1844, Horsford left the U.S. to study with noted chemist Justus von Liebig in Giessen, Germany, where he would remain for three years. Upon his return to the U.S., Horsford was chosen as the Rumford Professor and Lecturer on the Application of Science to the Useful Arts at Harvard University, where he would remain, teaching and publishing steadily until 1863. He would leave to focus his attention on the Rumford Chemical Works, a company he began in 1854 with George F. Wilson, who primarily ran the operational side of the business, to commercially produce Horsford’s chemical inventions and developments. The endeavor would make Horsford quite wealthy. Horsford’s most successful development was the modern formula for baking powder, but he also produced acid phosphate, anti-chlorine, yeast powder, and developed a process for condensing milk. During the end of the U.S. Civil War, Horsford put much time and energy into developing an “improved army ration” that involved the use of dehydrated meat; but although the project won the attention of several high ranking military and civilian leaders, it was never adopted. Rumford also developed a new method of manufacturing fire-proof safes, an improved method for attaching armor plating to warships, and conducted water analyses for municipalities in the Boston area. In 1873 Horsford was selected as a member of the U.S. Scientific Commission for the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien, or Vienna Exposition. Later in his life he became interested in the study of the “lost” city of Norumbega, which Horsford believed was a settlement of Viking explorers located in present Weston, Massachusetts. He published several treatises on the issue beginning in 1889, and had a monument erected to mark the supposed location of the settlement. Horsford’s findings on Norumbega and the Northmen have come to be generally disregarded. His appointment to Harvard convinced Samuel Gardiner to allow his daughter Mary L’Hommedieu Gardiner to wed E.N., and the two were married in 1847. Mary gave birth to four daughters: Mary Leila (Lilian) in 1848, Mary Catherine (Kate) in 1850, Gertrude Hubbard in 1852, and Mary Gardiner (Mamie) in 1855. Mary died a few months after the birth of Mamie. E.N. Horsford then married Mary’s sister Phoebe in 1857, and the couple had one daughter, Cornelia Conway Felton, in 1860. The Horsfords led an active social life centered on their Cambridge and Harvard communities. E.N. Horsford and his family were acquainted with several members of the “Boston Brahmin” as well as prominent figures of the Cambridge intelligentsia and literary community, including Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Henry Longfellow, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Helen Hunt Jackson to name but a few. Horsford strongly supported female education and became closely involved with Wellesley College, becoming president of its Board of Visitors in 1877, and honorary class member of the Class of 1886. He was close with Henry Fowle Durant, the school’s first president, and corresponded voluminously with students, teachers, and later presidents and administrators. On January 1, 1893, E.N. Horsford died at his home in Cambridge.</p>

She accompanied her father to Europe during his trip to the Vienna Exposition in 1873.

                        <p>Cornelia Horsford (1861-1944) was the only daughter of Phoebe and E.N. Horsford. In her younger years she usually appears by the name Nellie. She travelled extensively, including trips to Europe and the West with her family. Cornelia pursued an interest in archaeology, continuing her father’s work on the issue of Norumbega and the Northmen, and sponsored an expedition to Iceland to compare structures built by Viking settlers on that island to structures found in Massachusetts. She also conducted research on genealogy and the local history of Shelter Island and the manor. Following the death of Phoebe Horsford, Cornelia managed Sylvester Manor, taking a great interest in gardening and overseeing a substantial renovation to the manor in 1908. She also was an amateur painter of watercolors and a poet.</p>
