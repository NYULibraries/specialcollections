            <p>Playwright, writer and director Arthur Lee Kopit was born in 1937 in New York City. His first plays were staged while still an undergraduate at Harvard University. He leapt to public and critical attention with his play "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad: A Pseudoclassical Tragifarce in a Bastard French Tradition". Written while still in school, the play was published when Kopit was 23 and went on to productions in London and New York establishing his reputation for fusing disparate genres, absurdism, and a darkly comic world view. Later notable plays include "Indians" (1968), simultaneously a review of America's treatment of Native Americans and a critique of the Vietnam War; "Wings" (1978), a more somber story of a stroke victim's recovery; and "The End of the World" (1984), a mordant investigation of the arms race and nuclear destruction.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Kopit has written works for television and radio and books for musicals, often collaborating on the latter with composer and lyricist Maury Yeston. These works include "Nine" (1982), an adaptation of the Federico Fellini's film "8 1/2", and "Phantom" (1991), a musical version of 
                <emph render="italic">The Phantom of the Opera</emph> by Gaston Leroux that has been overshadowed by the more popular (though less critically acclaimed) version by Andrew Lloyd Weber.</p>
            <p>Kopit has taught at Wesleyan University, Yale University, and the City College of New York and has been the recipient of numerous awards, grants and fellowships. He currently resides in New York City.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Arthur Kopit Papers contain the professional and personal records of a distinguished an important playwright of the later 20th century. Kopit began his career while still a student at Harvard, quickly leapt to fame, and continued to produce major works for four decades. This collection thoroughly documents all aspects of his career from work on the stage, in the film industry, and on television. A tireless writer, the collection contains thorough documentation on numerous unproduced works for all media. Records also document Kopit's teaching work, his personal and family life and provide a solid picture of the theater world.</p>
            <p>The collection is divided into series as organized by the collection creator. The major series are Projects, Media, Business Files, and Personal Records. The arrangement within each series varies according to how the materials were organized by the creator and received by the depository.</p>
            <p>The first series, Projects, is also the largest series, comprising half the collection. The materials are organized alphabetically by project title as there was no order between them. Named project files go back no further than the late 1960's and thus do not include material on the early part of Kopit's career.</p>
            <p>The materials for each project present are in no particular order yet the materials fall into identifiable categories. The first category would be books, pamphlets, magazines, newspaper articles, journals, and any other material used as research for the project. This can include government publications in the case of 
                <emph render="italic">End of the World</emph>, or commercial pamphlets in the case of 
                <emph render="italic">Dream House</emph>. Many of the projects contain numerous tapes of interviews with experts, knowledgeable sources or persons relevant to the project's topic. Kopit also seemed to record reflections, notes and thoughts on tape.</p>
            <p>The second category would be handwritten drafts of the plays including preliminary outlines, diagrams, and sketches. Kopit worked extensively with index cards to structure the play or piece. He also made use of large sketchbooks and blank notebooks to write out ideas and schematize the work. There are indications that these cards and loose pages would be assembled on bulletin boards or compared against each other to map out the development of a work.</p>
            <p>Typewritten drafts make up a large portion of each project's files. Whole scripts as produced, annotated early drafts, and many partial copies of various successive versions tend to be present for each work. In some cases, later productions of the work have their own alterations and unique copies of the script.</p>
            <p>Lastly, project files contain correspondence with involved parties, contracts, photographs, promotional materials, material on casting, royalty agreements, publication material, copyright records and other files. These types of material are not as present in each project as the above types but still make regular appearances.</p>
            <p>The first part of the series consists of projects with enough records to occupy one more whole boxes. The second part of the series, titled miscellaneous works, are the records of productions taking up less than a single box. While these materials reflect all periods of Kopit's career, there is a particular presence of materials from earlier in his career. These are works which either did not require as much research and preparatory work as later projects, or for which more extensive documentation was never retained. Works documented here include "The Questioning of Nick", "Oh Dad, Poor Dad...", "The Day the Whores Came Out to Play Tennis...", "Mhil'daiim", "Secrets of the Rich", "Snatch", "Chamber Music", "What's Happened to the Thorne's House?", "On the Runway of Life You Never Know What's Coming Off Next", "An Incident in the Park", "Promontory Point Revisited", and "The Conquest of Everest". Some obscure unproduced works are present including a proposal and drafts of a screenplay or novel entitled "Fresh Game", works entitled "The Frog", "The Poet", "Fat City", "Edgar's Exploits" and other untitled and unidentified works.</p>
            <p>Series II: Media, consist of newspapers, magazines, and videotapes not found with or attached to any particular work. They are described as found. A large quantity of computer media is present. Apart from back up disks of operating systems and programs, the majority of the computer media is labeled disks of Kopit's project work. An additional body of media remains originating from leslie Garis and Kopit's children.</p>
            <p>Series III: Business Records is composed of files originally kept in filing cabinets and most often coming out of labeled folders and hanging files. These records are in discrete groups, whether by particular location or time period. Groups overlap in subject and nature of the records. Many business files resemble the project files in that they contain notes and research, correspondence relating to projects, productions, rights, royalties and publication. The business files also contain personal financial records including bank account statements, bills, receipts, ledgers, investment records, and home maintenance and property documents.</p>
            <p>Series IV: Personal records contains important documentation on Kopit's early life and professional career. While real juvenilia exists here including grade school and high school materials, papers, reports and notebooks, Kopit wrote numerous plays while still in college that went on to be professionally staged and published. Early drafts of works, correspondence relating both to school and writing, documents of Kopit's activities leading up to and past the Broadway premier of "Oh dad, Poor Dad..." and records running until the late 1960s are present here. Kopit kept voluminous scrapbooks of news clippings documenting the success of his plays and his rise in the New York theater world and society. A significant amount of records are present from his parents, a successful couple in New York City whose lives were closely intertwined with Kopit's during these decades.</p>
            <p>Series V: Miscellaneous is composed of two boxes of materials not easily identifiable or attributable to any specific project. It is likely that these two boxes will be assimilated into the above series upon further processing.</p>
            <p>Series VI: Other Author's Works comprises manuscripts of plays, short stories, story treatments, novels and books by other people. Some of these individuals may have been students, friends or professional associates of Kopit. Some are people Kopit had worked with or planned to work with. Yet others may have been unsolicited manuscripts. They are in order as found.</p>
            <p>Series VII: THE 3 BOXES IN THIS SERIES WERE DEACCESSIONED IN FEBRUARY 2009. Records of Kopit's Family comprises material largely generated by Kopit's wife, Leslie Garis. Garis' professional work is best known by a series of interviews she conducted with writers and other literary people that were published in the New York Times. Audio tapes, notes and drafts of those works are present here. Garis also worked for years on an (as yet) unpublished novel. This series contains numerous notebooks (some serving also as personal diaries), index cards, research, notes and drafts of that work. A small amount of juvenile correspondence is also present. One box here contains high school yearbooks, notebooks, papers, exams and other materials from Benjamin Kopit, the middle son.</p>
            <p>Flat boxes at the end of the collection contain oversized material separated from other series. Box description contain notes on separated materials and the materials are labeled as to their origin.</p>

            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>Within series, materials are arranged as found. Oversized materials are separated out and placed at the end of the collection. Folders are untitled; when a title is present in quotations it indicates that the material was found in a folder or hanging file or envelope with that inscription. Most materials found in envelopes were placed in discrete folders with the envelope or photocopy of the envelope retained.</p>

            <head>Separated Material</head>
            <p>There are five boxes of books separated from the Kopit collection. One box contains books of Kopit's published plays and works. Other books were either used by Kopit for research or simply ones collected for personal use. These books were only separated from the collection when they were not related to any project work or known or supposed to have been used for project research yet not found with or next to any project or project materials. Relevant books found among project materials were left in place. Additionally, two boxes of duplicated books, mostly multiple copies of Kopit's published plays, were removed from the collection. The list of separated titles follows:</p>

                    <p>This series contains material and records of plays, screenplays, teleplays and other works that Kopit wrote. There is material from one work he directed. Among all the named projects in the series, many were unproduced. These include the works The Shroud, The Frogs, Cheeky Peeky, Deception, Scientific Process, Norman in Wonderland, Treasure Island, Between the Wars, Deep Purple, Discovery of America, Dream House, MK-Ultra, and Starstruck. Other projects Kopit worked on eventually reached the stage or screen without his final involvement or credit. These include Dr. Zhivago, Sweet Smell of Success, Till Death Us Do Part, In a Child's Name, and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Yet among these records is material on some of Kopit's greatest popular and critical successes such as Wings, Indians, Nine, Phantom and End of the World as well as other endeavors such as the TV movies Roswell, Hands of a Stranger and his adaptation of the Henrik Ibsen play Ghosts. The quality and particular nature of documentation for each project varies. Some works contain greater record of the actual inception of the play through notebooks and index cards and research. Other projects contain a greater amount of material documenting the staging and production. The more successful projects such as Phantom, End of the World and Road to Nirvana contain considerable information on regional, touring and international productions.</p>

                        <p>Phantom was first conceived by Kopit and Maury Yeston as a musical around 1983, then recreated as a non-musical teleplay although the teleplay was aired (in 1990) before the musical premiered (in 1991). Notebooks, handwritten drafts, and typewritten scripts of the teleplay exist here, dated beginning 1988. Also included are correspondence, financial information, chronologies of events, scripts and drafts for the musical, score fragments, reviews, programs, casting notes.

Proposals, descriptions and outlines for that work, apparently a collaborative travelling show based on ecological issues. "Hamburger...." and "Lewis and Clark" may have been other contributions or evolutions of this concept by Kopit as many of the records are found together and all works were planned around the Bicentennial celebrations of 1976. Handwritten and typewritten script drafts of "Asylum", "Endplay". Pamphlets, ephemera, and other materials on human rights, ecology, arts organizations and miscellaneous materials.

                        <p>Manuscript copy of book on Marlene Dietrich with annotations, most likely "Blue Angel" by Donald Spoto; a folder concerning a "10 minute play"; a script of "In a Child's Name", materials on "Between the Wars", assorted business files and ledgers, and notes and index cards of "The Poet". Following "The Poet" folder is a set of older records from the 1960s consisting of correspondence, contracts, files on "Lewis and Clark", materials from a teaching stint at Wesleyan, and a mixed folder of various older script fragments and notes. At the end of a box are materials related to an unproduced collaboration with Danny Elfman on a work of his creation called "Jimmy Callicutt".

                    <p>This series is divided by type of media into publications, video tapes, computer media and assorted media. Many books were found in the collection. Those that were obviously used for research, and were found with other materials for their respective projects, were left in place. Those that were found in discrete groups were separated from the collection. A list of those books can be found at back. Some of the books seem to have been used as research, some seem to be just discards from Kopit's personal library; many of the books are multiple copies of Kopit's published works. All but one copy of each edition have been removed from the collection. Other publications include magazines, playbills, programs and newspapers. Some have articles by or on Kopit,m some are periodicals acquired for research while others are in the collection for no apparent reason.</p>
                    <p>The videotapes, a more extensive collection, include research on works (including prior versions of films and stories); home movies; feature tapes of performances of Kopit plays around the world; video copies of the daily reels of the filming of 
                        <emph render="italic">Roswell</emph> as well as preliminary versions of the entire film; nineteen U-matic tapes of unknown content though some seem to be home movies and recordings of tv shows.</p>
                    <p>Computer media consist of a variety of materials. Most of the media are 5 inch floppy disks with numerous applications and programs; Kopit has often included printouts and notes for the contents and documentation of the computer system. Boxes 65 and 67 consist of numerous backups of drafts and scripts of works; among the disks are labels that refer to previously unmentioned works and projects including "The Poet", found on numerous disks and dated 1991; possible work done on an unproduced musical version of Tom Swift; "Tricks of the Trade", a project noted as being a "Bob Brown/Coco idea"; an unnamed project with Audrey Cooper; "The Byte of Love", "Hasten the Bullet", and "Arcata". Box 66 contains similar material as well as a significant collection of writings and materials by Kopit's wife, Leslie Garis (LG), and computer records by Kopit's children Alex, Ben and Katherine (Kat). The materials will be separated into their own box and placed at the end of the collection in their own series. Scattered throughout are disks of applications, operating systems, and utilities.</p>

                    <p>This series is composed of numerous distinct groups of files apparently organized and accumulated at different times over three or four decades. The contents of each group are similar as records relating to personal and family finances are mixed in with materials relating to various works and productions. Among the personal materials are significant amounts of receipts, expenditure records, checking account and other bank statements, records relating to home maintenance, automobiles, mortgages, and income taxes. There is a significant body of records relating to the separate trusts Kopit established for each of his children and the investment records and taxes on them over the last two decades.</p>
                    <p>Among the work-related records are significant amounts of correspondence and contracts recording the legal details and royalty payments of foreign and regional productions of his stage plays and publications of them in numerous countries. There are records relating Kopit's work in the television and film industry as well as some records relating the development of specific works. In particular, in this series is the only significant material relating to a small one-act play entitled "Elegy for the House that Ruth Built" that Kopit wrote to include in "Hitting for the Cycle" a production of numerous short plays about baseball, ca. 1996.</p>

Stevens for a Kennedy Center Honors program in 1988.

                    <p>Personal materials in the Kopit collection fall into typical types of records. There is a significant amount of ephemera including high school yearbooks and newspapers, scrapbooks from the 1960" that chart the success of Kopit's plays, their influence on theater and on cultured society of New York, and Kopit's rise in the same community. There is an additional large amount of newspaper reviews, clippings and advertisements saved by Kopit and his family or forwarded to them by Audrey Wood, Kopit's agent, or by friends and professional acquaintances.</p>
                    <p>A large amount of documentation exists here on Kopit's years at Harvard from which he graduated in 1959. These include papers, exam books and notebooks. Extensive correspondence between Kopit and his parents and friends, and drafts and copies of scripts Kopit wrote while at Harvard including "Oh Dad, Poor Dad...", "Sing to Me Through Open Windows", "The Questioning of Nick" and "The Death of Houdini." The correspondence details the development and staging of these works at Harvard and the collection includes ticket stubs, stage bills reviews and notices of them. The personal files also yield records on Kopit's activity following his graduation, when he traveled in Europe, and leading up to and beyond the Broadway Premiere of "Oh Dad, Poor Dad...". The files provide a sketchier picture of Kopit's activities after the mid-1960s but help fill in details on the development and staging of "Indians", his marriage to Leslie Garis, and other activities.</p>
                    <p>Many materials here including correspondence appear to have been in the possession of Kopit's parents, George and Maxine. Mixed in then with materials relating to Arthur are correspondence between Gorge and Maxine Kopit and others, business records, bills and other materials for the elder Kopit's, and records of Arthur's career clearly collected by the parents. There is a large amount of photographs, the greater portion of them from Kopit's childhood up until his first success, his parents, extended family and perhaps further ancestors. None are labeled. Two boxes of material created originating from Leslie Garis (journals, diaries, and extensive documentation of the writing of her unpublished novel) have been moved to the end of the collection.</p>

                    <p>The following boxes contain materials mostly generated by Leslie Garis. Garis worked as a journalist writing a notable series of interviews with writers for the New York Times in the 1980s and 1990s. She also wrote an (as yet) unpublished novel. The materials include numerous tape recordings, notes and other materials from her journalism as well as copious notebooks, index cards and drafts of her novel. The third box consists of material from Benjamin Kopit's high school years as well as yearbooks from other of Kopit's children. Note that a significant amount of work by Leslie Garis, as well as Kopit's three children, exist on floppy disks located in box 91, Computer Media Box 2. Those materials may later be moved to this series.</p>
